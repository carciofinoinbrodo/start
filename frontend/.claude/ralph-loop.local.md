Improve the whole UI of the application. I want it similar to campsite (check here the design: www.saasui.design slash application slash campsite). Implement it and test it using playwright and the tools you have at your disposal. Check also the design images at  Users federicobrancasi Downloads DESIGNS and use the frontend skill or plugin you have to make it even better. MAKE IT ALSO RESPONSIVE FOR EVERY TIME OF DEVICE AND FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE PHONE VERSION SHOW THE THINGS IN A NICE WAY DOESNT HAVE TO BE THE SAME WAY AS THE DESKTOP ONE, CAUSE YOU HAVE A SMALLER SCREEN SO THINK HARD ABOUT HOW TO DO IT. DO AT LEAST 4 ITERATIONS
